-memoize (remember):
    and re-use solutions to **subproblems** that help solve the problem.
    => DP is recursion + memoization.
    Time = #subproblems * time spent / subproblem

    5 easy steps:
    1. Define subproblems.
    2. Guess (part of solution).
    3. Relate subproblem solutions.
    4. Recurse and memoize.
    5. Solve original problem.
